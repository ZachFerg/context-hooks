Following along with The Net Ninjas [React Context and Hooks Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hNokByJilPg5g9m2APUePI).

## Lesson 1

* Setting up project to showcase the context API in React
* Installed **'Simple React Snippets'** for VS Code

## Lesson 2

* #### Context API:
> Shares state within a component tree (Can be done with props, but gets messy).
> Can be used alongside hooks and makes sharing data between components much easier.

#### [React Context Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

> Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.

If you ever are unsure wether you should use context, ask yourself: **Is the data that I want to share global, and is it gonna be used in several of the child components?**

> Context is not a catch-all for every situation, just for global state thats shared between many different components in a tree.
> This is also a good time to download the **React Developer Tools** Extension for Chrome
